    <h1>About PlanMyKorea</h1>
    <p>
      PlanMyKorea is an independent travel information website created to help
      international visitors plan smarter, more confident trips to South Korea.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is independently operated and maintained by a private editor.
      It is not a government website and is not affiliated with the Korean
      government, immigration authorities, airports, airlines, insurance
      providers, telecom companies, or official tourism organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>The goal of PlanMyKorea is simple:</p>
    <p>
      To provide practical, decision-focused travel guidance for international
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>We focus on helping travelers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand entry and arrival basics</li>
      <li>Navigate transportation systems with clarity</li>
      <li>Estimate realistic travel costs</li>
      <li>Choose areas and travel styles that fit their plans</li>
      <li>Avoid common mistakes that cause confusion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We prioritize clarity over promotion. When a decision depends on season,
      nationality, or personal travel style, we explain the differences instead
      of offering one generic answer.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Approach Information</h2>
    <p>Official sources first.</p>
    <p>
      Whenever possible, we base guidance on publicly available official
      sources such as immigration services, airports, railway operators, and
      transportation authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travel policies, prices, and procedures may change. For important matters
      such as entry requirements, we strongly recommend confirming final details
      through official announcements before departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is designed to help you plan and understand - not to replace
      official instructions.
    </p>

    <h2>Independence &amp; Monetization Transparency</h2>
    <p>PlanMyKorea is independently operated.</p>
    <p>To support the maintenance of this website, we may use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advertising services (such as Google AdSense)</li>
      <li>Affiliate links to travel-related services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If affiliate links are used, there is no additional cost to you.</p>
    <p>
      Monetization does not determine editorial decisions. Content is written to
      prioritize clarity and usefulness for travelers.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy &amp; Update Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We make a good-faith effort to keep information accurate and current.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Major content updates are reviewed periodically.</li>
      <li>
        Important policy-related pages may be updated when changes are
        confirmed.
      </li>
      <li>Significant updates may be date-stamped for transparency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, entry requirements, prices, operating hours, and transportation
      rules can change without notice and may vary depending on nationality or
      personal circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always verify critical travel details through official sources before
      making final decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Website Does Not Provide</h2>
    <p>PlanMyKorea does not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide visa processing services</li>
      <li>Offer booking, ticketing, or reservation services</li>
      <li>Provide legal or immigration advice</li>
      <li>Act as a government authority or official agency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This website provides general informational guidance only.</p>

    <h2>Contact &amp; Corrections</h2>

      If you notice factual errors or outdated information, please contact us
      through the Contact page.
    </p>
