    <p>

      information website created to help international visitors plan trips to
      South Korea.
    </p>
    <p>
      We respect your privacy and aim to be transparent about what information
      may be collected and how it may be used.
    </p>

    <h2>1) Information We Do Not Collect Directly</h2>
    <p>
      We do not ask visitors to submit personal information in order to read
      most content on this website.

    <h2>2) Information That May Be Collected Automatically</h2>
    <p>
      Like most websites, limited data may be collected automatically through

      <li>Pages visited and approximate time on page</li>
      <li>Referring/exit pages, general location (approximate region)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is generally used for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Website security and performance</li>
      <li>Traffic measurement and site improvement</li>
      <li>Advertising delivery and measurement (where applicable)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Third-Party Services We Use</h2>
    <p>
      PlanMyKorea uses third-party services that may place cookies or use
      similar technologies.
    </p>
    <p>These services may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdSense (advertising)</li>
      <li>Google Analytics (traffic analysis)</li>
      <li>
        Microsoft Clarity (user behavior analytics such as interactions and
        usage patterns)
      </li>
      <li>Cloudflare (security, performance, and content delivery)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These providers may collect data automatically as described above,
      according to their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>4) Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small text files stored on your device. This website and our
      service providers may use cookies (or similar technologies) for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Essential functionality and security</li>
      <li>Measuring traffic and improving site usability</li>
      <li>Advertising delivery and ad measurement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can control cookies through your browser settings.</p>
    <p>Disabling cookies may affect certain site functions.</p>

    <h2>5) Advertising (Google AdSense)</h2>
    <p>
      Third-party vendors, including Google, may use cookies to serve ads based
      on your visits to this and other websites.
    </p>
    <p>You can manage ad personalization settings and learn more here:</p>
    <p>
      Google Ad Settings:
      <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://adssettings.google.com
      </a>
      <br />
      Google Ads &amp; data usage:
      <a

    <h2>6) We Do Not Sell Personal Data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>
    <p>
      Some third-party services may process data for analytics or advertising
      purposes as described above. We do not receive or store sensitive
      personal information such as passport numbers, payment details, or
      government IDs.
    </p>

    <h2>7) International Visitors</h2>
    <p>
      PlanMyKorea is used by visitors from many countries. Depending on your
      location, you may have rights under privacy laws (such as GDPR in the
      EEA/UK or certain U.S. state laws).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we do not operate user accounts and do not directly collect
      sensitive personal information, most data processing occurs through the
      third-party services listed above. You can typically exercise controls
      through:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cookie controls in your browser</li>
      <li>Provider opt-out or ad personalization tools (see links above)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable technical measures to help protect the website and
      reduce risk (for example, security and performance tools).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, no method of online transmission or storage is 100% secure. Use
      this website at your own discretion.
    </p>
